# 🇧🇩 Bangladesh Flag Pattern using Python

This is a simple Python program where I tried to draw the flag of Bangladesh using basic pattern printing with Unicode characters.

In this pattern:
- 🔴 The red circle is printed using a basic circle formula.
- 🟩 The green background is created with loop logic around it.

###  What I used:
- Basic `for` loops
- Simple math for circular shape
- Unicode characters for visual representation

###  Output (Text-based preview):

🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🔴🔴🔴🟩🟩🟩🟩  
🟩🟩🟩🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🟩🟩🟩  
...

This project helped me understand how patterns work and how to be creative with simple logic.
